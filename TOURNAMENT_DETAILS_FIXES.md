# Tournament Details Page Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Unnecessary Stats from Hero Section
**Before**: Showed Prize Pool, Teams Registered, Days, and Status
**After**: Shows only Status (centered)

**Changes Made**:
- Removed prize pool, team count, and duration from hero stats HTML
- Removed corresponding JavaScript that populated these values
- Centered the remaining status item in the hero stats section

### 2. ✅ Fixed Tournament Status Logic
**Before**: Confusing status like "Registration" 
**After**: Clear statuses: "Upcoming", "Registrations Open", "Ongoing", "Completed"

**Status Logic**:
- **"Upcoming"**: Before registration starts OR after registration ends but before tournament starts
- **"Registrations Open"**: During registration period (between registration start and end dates)
- **"Ongoing"**: During tournament period (between tournament start and end dates)  
- **"Completed"**: After tournament ends

### 3. ✅ Fixed Register Button Visibility Logic
**Before**: Register button showed at wrong times
**After**: Register button only shows when registrations are actually open

**Button Logic**:
- **Show Register Button**: Only when current date is between registration start and end dates
- **Hide Register Button**: All other times (upcoming, ongoing, completed)
- **Proper Authentication**: Register button requires user login

### 4. ✅ Removed "Learn More" Button
**Before**: Had unnecessary "Learn More" button since user is already on details page
**After**: Removed the button entirely

**Changes Made**:
- Removed secondary action button from HTML
- Removed all JavaScript references to secondary action button
- Simplified hero actions to only show register button when appropriate

### 5. ✅ Fixed Hero Section Image Visibility
**Before**: Images were too dark due to heavy overlays
**After**: Balanced visibility - images are visible while text remains readable

**Overlay Changes**:
- **Reduced base overlay**: From `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)` to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)`
- **Lighter poster overlay**: From `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)` to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)`
- **Better image support**: Added support for backgroundImage from tournament data
- **Maintained readability**: Text still clearly visible with lighter overlays

### 6. ✅ Enhanced Background Image Support
**Before**: Only checked specific poster fields
**After**: Also checks backgroundImage field from tournament data

**Image Sources** (in priority order):
1. `tournament.posterImage`
2. `tournament.poster` 
3. `tournament.thumbnailUrl`
4. `tournament.imageUrl`
5. `tournament.backgroundImage` ← **New**

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Before Registration Opens**: Status shows "Upcoming", no register button
2. **During Registration**: Status shows "Registrations Open", register button visible
3. **After Registration Closes**: Status shows "Upcoming", no register button  
4. **During Tournament**: Status shows "Ongoing", no register button, leaderboard visible
5. **After Tournament**: Status shows "Completed", no register button, final results visible

The tournament details page now provides a much cleaner, more intuitive experience with proper status communication and logical button behavior.
