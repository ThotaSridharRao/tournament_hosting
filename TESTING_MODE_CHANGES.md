# Testing Mode Changes for Tournament Registration

## Overview
Modified the tournament registration system to skip payment requirements for testing purposes.

## Frontend Changes (team-registration.html)

### 1. Visual Indicators
- Added a green testing mode banner at the top of the page
- Updated registration summary to show "FREE" instead of entry fee
- Modified payment structure to show crossed-out fees with "FREE" label
- Changed register button text to "Register Team (Testing Mode)"

### 2. Registration Flow Changes
- Modified `submitRegistration()` function to skip payment process
- Added auto-approval call after successful registration
- Updated success messages to indicate testing mode
- Reduced redirect delay to 1.5 seconds

### 3. UI Updates
- Registration summary shows crossed-out fees with green "FREE" text
- Payment structure shows testing mode indicators
- Success messages include testing mode context

## Backend Changes

### 1. New Testing Endpoint
- Added `approveTeamForTesting()` function in team.controller.js
- Route: `PATCH /api/teams/:teamId/approve-testing`
- Allows team captains to auto-approve their teams for testing
- Updates team status from 'pending' to 'approved'

### 2. Route Configuration
- Added new testing route in team.routes.js
- Protected with JWT authentication
- Only team captain can approve their own team

## How It Works

1. User fills out registration form normally
2. Form submits to existing registration endpoint
3. Team is created with 'pending' status
4. Frontend automatically calls the testing approval endpoint
5. Team status is updated to 'approved'
6. User sees success message and is redirected to dashboard
7. No payment processing occurs

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to team-registration.html with a tournament slug
2. Fill out team details and player information
3. Click "Register Team (Testing Mode)" button
4. Team should be registered and approved automatically
5. User should be redirected to team dashboard

## Reverting Changes

To revert to normal payment flow:
1. Remove the testing mode banner
2. Restore original registration summary and payment structure functions
3. Remove auto-approval call from submitRegistration()
4. Update button text back to include payment reference
5. Remove testing endpoint from backend (optional)

## Notes

- Testing mode is clearly indicated throughout the UI
- Original payment logic is preserved and can be easily restored
- Backend testing endpoint is separate from admin approval system
- Changes are minimal and focused on the registration flow
