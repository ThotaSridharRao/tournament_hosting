# Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Errors
**Problem:** Frontend couldn't access backend API due to CORS policy restrictions.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Updated `earena_Backend/api/app.js` CORS configuration
- Added more allowed origins (localhost:8000, 127.0.0.1:8000, etc.)
- Made CORS more permissive in development mode
- Added support for file:// protocol for local HTML files

### 2. Wrong API URL Configuration
**Problem:** Frontend was trying to access deployed backend instead of local backend.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Updated `team-registration.html` to auto-detect environment
- Local development: uses `http://localhost:8000`
- Production: uses `https://tournament-hosting-backend.onrender.com`
- Added debugging logs to show which API URL is being used

### 3. Backend Port Configuration
**Problem:** Frontend was trying to connect to port 3000, but backend runs on port 8000.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Updated frontend API URL to use correct port (8000)
- Verified backend configuration in `index.js`

### 4. Missing Error Handling and Debugging
**Problem:** No clear indication when backend connection fails.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added API connection test function
- Added debugging logs for environment detection
- Added user-friendly error messages when backend is unreachable
- Added console logging for troubleshooting

## Files Modified

1. **earena_Backend/api/app.js**
   - Enhanced CORS configuration
   - Added development mode permissive CORS
   - Added more allowed origins

2. **kiro test/team-registration.html**
   - Auto-detecting API URL based on environment
   - Added API connection testing
   - Added debugging and error handling
   - Updated to use correct backend port (8000)

3. **earena_Backend/api/controllers/team.controller.js**
   - Fixed import casing issues
   - Added testing endpoint for auto-approval

4. **earena_Backend/api/routes/team.routes.js**
   - Fixed import casing issues
   - Added testing route

## How to Test the Fixes

1. **Start Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd earena_Backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open Frontend:**
   - Open `team-registration.html` in browser
   - Check browser console for debugging messages
   - Should see: "‚úÖ API connection successful"

3. **Test Registration:**
   - Add tournament slug to URL: `?slug=test-tournament`
   - Fill out registration form
   - Click "Register Team (Testing Mode)"

## Expected Console Output

When working correctly, you should see:
```
üîß Environment Detection: {hostname: "127.0.0.1", protocol: "file:", isLocal: true, apiUrl: "http://localhost:8000"}
üîç Testing API connection to: http://localhost:8000
‚úÖ API connection successful
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still see errors:

1. **"Failed to fetch"** - Backend server not running
2. **"CORS policy"** - Check CORS configuration in app.js
3. **"Connection refused"** - Wrong port or backend not started
4. **"404 Not Found"** - Wrong API endpoint or route not registered

## Next Steps

1. Start the backend server using the guide in `BACKEND_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
2. Test the registration flow with a valid tournament
3. Check browser console for any remaining errors
4. Verify the testing mode works as expected
